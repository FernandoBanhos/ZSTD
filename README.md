# ZSTD - ZStandard
 
Zstandard is a fast compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression. The reference library offers a very wide range of speed / compression trade-off, and is backed by an extremely fast decoder (see benchmarks below). Zstandard library is provided as open source software using a BSD license. Its format is stable and published as [IETF RFC 8878](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8878).

# LZ4

LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed > 500 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.
